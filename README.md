# Iris Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This project demonstrates a simple machine learning classification task using Python and the well-known Iris dataset.  
The goal is to classify different iris flower species based on features such as petal and sepal dimensions, using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

It was created as part of my journey into data science and algorithms, and as a showcase of my Python and data handling skills.

## ðŸ’¬ Motivation

This project was created as part of my preparation for applying to algorithm and machine learning-related roles, such as the Software Engineer Student position at ThetaRay.

Iâ€™m passionate about data, problem-solving, and learning more about intelligent systems, and this is one step in that journey.
